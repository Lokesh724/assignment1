<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>This is a brief introduction about myself. I am a 3rd-year Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong foundation in Python and C programming. My passion lies in exploring IoT device security protocols and building innovative projects. I have successfully completed an internship as a student partner through Internshala and actively participated in hackathons, such as the Cicada Tech Fest. Currently, I am working on an Online Voting System project to make voting secure and efficient, alongside my teammates Kushal and Harshath. I aim to continuously grow my technical skills, gain hands-on experience through internships, and secure a strong position as a skilled engineer.
